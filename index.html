      <h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>
      <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Impressionism</dt>
        <dd>Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</dd>
        <dt>Abstract Expressionism</dt>
        <dd>This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</dd>
        <dt>Pop Art</dt>
        <dd>A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</dd>
      </dl>
